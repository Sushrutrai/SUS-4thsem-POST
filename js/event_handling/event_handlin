Event Handling
1. Image Gallery Viewer
o Create an image gallery where each thumbnail image can be clicked to display the full-size image.
o Use event handlers to listen for click events on the thumbnail images.
o When a thumbnail is clicked, prevent the default action and instead display the full-size image in a
designated area of the page.
2. Form Validation
o Create a form with fields for username, email, and password.
o Use event handlers to validate the input in real-time as the user types into each field.
o Display error messages next to the relevant field if the input is invalid.
3. Dynamic List Filtering
o Create a list of items and a search box.
o As the user types into the search box, use an event handler to dynamically filter the list to
only include items that match the search query.
4. Drag and Drop Interface
o Create an interface with draggable elements.
o Use event handlers to update the position of the elements as they are dragged and dropped.
